# Hypothesis Testing on Electric Car Usage Rates for Autolib

This analysis demonstrates the hypothesis testing process on a data science project.

Some of the techniques discussed include univariate and bivariate data analysis, sampling approach, null and alternate hypotheses as well as test statistics.

# Project Description

Autolib was an electric car sharing service company in France that was operational between 2011 and 2018. The company had three types of electric cars i.e blue cars, Utilib cars and Utilib 1.4 cars. Blue cars were most popularly used. These cars were available across various cities and postal codes in France and renters could pick up cars in one station then drop them off at a different station that was closer to their destination.

 
Null Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars returned is the same as utilib cars taken.

Ho : μ1 = μ2 

Alternate Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars returned is not the same as utilib cars taken.

Ha : μ1 ≠ μ2
